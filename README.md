#Model Comparison: Linear Regression vs. Random Forest
This repository contains a Python model that performs predictive analysis using two different algorithms: Linear Regression and Random Forest. The goal of this project is to compare the performance of these two approaches in predicting the target variable.

The model follows a simple workflow. First, it utilizes Linear Regression to train on a dataset containing independent variables and their corresponding dependent variable. The model then uses this trained linear regression model to make predictions on a test dataset.

Next, the model employs the Random Forest algorithm to train on the same dataset and make predictions on the test dataset. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to generate predictions.

The model evaluates the performance of both algorithms by comparing their predictive accuracy. The dataset is divided into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set, ensuring a fair assessment of the models' abilities.

In addition to the comparison, this model provides visualizations of the data, allowing for a better understanding of the relationships between variables and the performance of the algorithms. These visualizations help in gaining insights into the dataset and aid in decision-making processes.

Feel free to explore the notebook and experiment with different datasets to observe how the Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms perform. Enjoy analyzing and comparing the results obtained from these predictive models!

Please note that the code and information in this repository are for educational and experimental purposes.
